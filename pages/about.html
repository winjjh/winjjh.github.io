<section class="statement">
  <P>I've been studying in Graphic Design for 2 years. I transfered from Maryland Institue college of Arts in Baltimore to The New School, Parsons in New York. I am fascinated by make-up industires especially displaying design, product development, branding, packaging design, etc. Also, I like to design products that are environment-friendly. My final goal is to create a cosmetic brand that are eco-friendly and playful.</P>
  
  <P>Apart from my interest in graphic design, I also have interest in UX | UI design because it gives strong connection with consumers. By doing and learning interaction design, I can understand both side of a consumer and a developer. In this respect, I can take a position or shift my ground as a consumer and developer to have better understanding and apply those practice in my design. </P>
